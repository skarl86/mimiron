## Why Mimiron

Most "AI coding agents" are a single LLM in a loop. That works for tiny edits and breaks the moment a feature needs *spec discipline*, *parallel work*, or *retry-without-drift*.

Mimiron is a **harness**, not an agent. It treats LLM output as a *suspect* and the file system as ground truth. Every phase transition is decided by a **deterministic gate**, every worker output is **hash-verified**, and every loop has a **safety pin** that stops the agent from spinning.

Named for the [titan keeper of Ulduar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mimiron) — engineer-craftsman of mechanical guardians, obsessed with measured construction over speed.

## Quick start

In any Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add skarl86/mimiron
/plugin install mimiron@mimiron
```

(The `@mimiron` suffix is the marketplace alias — it matches the `name` field in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and happens to coincide with the plugin name. The duplication is visual, not a typo.)

That's it for the plugin install — `/mimiron`, `/mimiron-status`, `/mimiron-resume`, `/mimiron-pause`, and `/mimiron-unstuck` slash commands are now live, along with the 8 skills, 3 worker agents, and 3 hooks (SessionStart / Stop / PostToolUse drift).

Then in your project, kick off a feature:

```
/mimiron "Add a /version endpoint to the Flask app"
```

The full 6-phase pipeline triggers: Socratic clarification → frozen spec → DAG of tasks → parallel worker dispatch → deterministic gate evaluation → finalize with a commit suggestion. `state.json` is the ledger your hooks (and you) can interrupt at any phase.

### One more step — install the CLI (currently required, v0.1.0)

> ⚠️ Today the skills above call `mimiron init`, `mimiron gate`, `mimiron commit-task` etc. as Bash commands. **They expect the `mimiron` CLI on `$PATH`** — plugin install alone does *not* put it there. Fix is tracked in [#15](https://github.com/skarl86/mimiron/issues/15); for now run once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skarl86/mimiron /tmp/mimiron && cd /tmp/mimiron
uv pip install -e .         # or: pip install -e .
```

Bootstrap a fresh project's mechanical toolchain in one shot:

```bash
mimiron init my-feature --bootstrap-toolchain=python-uv   # or python-pip | node-npm | go
```

This writes `.mimiron/_global/{mechanical.toml,thresholds.yaml}` from the `evals/` templates so `gate mechanical` works out of the box.

## The 6-phase pipeline

```
clarify ──τ──▶ spec ──q──▶ plan ──c──▶ execute ──a──▶ evaluate ──v──▶ finalize ─▶ done
   ▲             ▲           ▲            ▲│              ▲│
   │             │           │      retry │└── fail ──────┘│
   │             │           │       ≤3   │                │
   │             │           │            ▼                │
   └─────────────┴───────────┴─────── stuck ◀──── fail × 3 ┘
                                         │
                                         ▼
                                      paused (via unstuck)
```

Each arrow is a **gate** — a deterministic LLM-free check that decides phase transition:

| Gate | Phase exit | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| **τ ambiguity** | clarify → spec | `ambiguity_score ≤ 0.20` (median-of-3, certainty band ±0.05) |
| **q quality** | spec → plan | `quality_score ≥ 0.85` (with reviewer-ratio penalty) |
| **c plan integrity** | plan → execute | DAG cycle-free + owned_files conflict-free + spec_hash frozen |
| **a artifacts** | execute → evaluate | All tasks committed, hashes match worker declarations |
| **v evaluate** | evaluate → finalize | Mechanical (build/test/lint) + Semantic (reviewer median-of-3) |

`fail × 3` → `stuck` → `unstuck` skill engages. The user decides; the agent does not auto-recover.

## Concepts

### 3-Lane separation

Every code path lives in exactly one lane. Cross-lane calls are *structurally* prevented.

```
Creative lane  →  skills (markdown) + agents (Task tool)
                  LLM-driven judgment, no direct state mutation.

Deterministic  →  CLI (mimiron, mimiron-bench)
                  Zero LLM calls. Pure file IO + Python.

Persistence    →  hooks (SessionStart, Stop, PostToolUse)
                  Light glue. Only re-entry + drift logging.
```

### 14-pin safety architecture

| Pin | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **6-fold infinite loop defense** | spec § 5.4 | gate block → retry≤3 → consec_fail≥3 → unstuck → wall_clock 4h → token budget 500K |
| **4-fold judge defense** | spec § 6.4 | median-of-3 + temperature=0, certainty band, acceptance contract penalty, mutation opt-in |
| **5-fold outer-loop pin** | spec § 7.5.5 | benchmark suite halt: iteration_cap, asymptote, all_deferred, wall_clock, user_abort |

Total: 6 + 4 + 5 + spec_hash freeze (1) + 3-Lane structural (1) = **14 pins** + `unstuck` as personified safety mechanism.

### Spec freeze contract

Plan-time spec hash is recorded in `state.json`. Every subsequent CLI call (`scan`, `commit-task`, `gate semantic`, `archive`) re-hashes `spec.yaml` and **rejects** drift. The only way to unlock is `state.spec_unlocked=true` via `unstuck` flow.

### Self-host

Mimiron evaluates itself with `mimiron-bench`. The benchmark suite curates real merged PRs into reproducible fixtures (currently 3: B01–B03, drawn from production `naver-smartstore` traffic). Suite aggregate score gates `v0 → v1` graduation.

## Status

**v0.1.0 — form complete.** Every spec § 4.1 component exists, every phase transition is automated, two dogfood runs (one defect-finding, one verification) closed the feedback loop with **zero remaining workarounds**.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Plugin layout (§ 4.1) | ✅ all components present |
| 6-phase auto flow | ✅ zero manual state edits |
| Safety pins (14 + unstuck) | ✅ specified, implemented, tested |
| 3-Lane separation | ✅ structurally enforced |
| Dogfood runs | ✅ 3 archived (8 defects found → 8 fixed) |
| Benchmarks | ⏳ 3 curated, real LLM judge interactive-only |
| `mimiron-bench suite ≥ 0.75` (real judge) | ⏳ pending interactive dogfood with real judge |

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the road to v1.

## Contributing

Mimiron is *itself* the harness it builds. Use `/mimiron "<your contribution>"` and let it drive its own evolution. Defects discovered during a dogfood run are first-class artifacts — archive them in `dogfood/NNN-*.md` and fix in subsequent commits.
